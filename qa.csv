OOPs Concepts,"Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). For example, in Python, method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This enables the same method name to be used in different contexts with different behaviors."
How does a file compile when we run a program,"When a program is run, the source code file undergoes a compilation process. The steps are: Preprocessing: The preprocessor handles directives like #include and #define. Compilation: The compiler translates the preprocessed code into assembly or intermediate code. Assembly: The assembler converts the intermediate code into machine code, generating object files. Linking: The linker combines object files and libraries into a single executable file. It resolves external references and produces the final executable."
